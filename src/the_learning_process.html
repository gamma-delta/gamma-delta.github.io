		<p>This webpage is intended to teach you about the learning process.</p>
		<p>You will start out knowing absolutely nothing about the nature of these puzzles. By the end, however, you will be very good at them.</p>
		<p>Then, you will discuss the way you got a handle on the puzzles with the rest of the class, and finally solve a puzzle together.</p>
		
		<p>Example puzzle:</p>
		<canvas id="00" width = "512" height = "512"></canvas>
